funcs:
  check register: make sure 0<=r#<=7
  check constant: make sure no more than 10 bits (inc. sign)
facts:
  "word" - 10 bits - like a byte
  total mem size - 256
  program starts at mem location - 100
  char enc - ascii
  Labels can be referenced before they are declared
  between lines - a single newline (\n)
  max line length - 80 (not including \n)
  comments are ';'
  strings end with \0
  entry - points to code in this file, and exports it
  extern - points to an argument word, which referenced this label

  OP encoding:
    encoding of first word in op:
      9..6    5..4      3..2        1..0
      opcode  src type  dest type   E,R,A
    number base in output files - base 4 - a,b,c,d
    ops in assembly file always lowercase
    E,R,A: External, Absolute, Relocatable
      00 - Absolute
      01 - External
      10 - Relocatable
    type ids:
      0 - Immediate/constant
      1 - Label
      2 - Matrix
      3 - Register

  Matrix access:
      0.....1 2.................9
       Reloc          +20

      0...1  2......5 6.....9
       Abs    r_1     r_2
  
examples:
  .data     +7, -57, 17, 9
